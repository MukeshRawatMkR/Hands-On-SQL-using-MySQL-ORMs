# Having
*The 'HAVING' clause was added to SQL because the 'WHERE' keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.*
*to filter on group by clause we use HAVING, 'where' doesn't support filter on group by*
*Having <-> groups*
*Where <-> rows*

**Syntax**
- SELECT column_name(s), aggregate_function(column_name)
- FROM table_name
- WHERE condition
- GROUP BY column_name(s)
- HAVING condition
- ORDER BY column_name(s);
