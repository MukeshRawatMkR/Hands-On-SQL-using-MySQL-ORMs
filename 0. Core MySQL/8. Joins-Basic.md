# Intro To Joins 
- Based on common coloumn we join the tables(two or more) to show the data.
*common col: which is PK in one table and is (FK) in another table*

**syntax**
- SELECT * from table1 inner join table2 on table1.<fk-col> = table2.<pk-col>;
 *That's Inner join*
 *INNER keyword is optional*
